ğŸš‘ Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard | Excel Project ğŸ“Š

Iâ€™m excited to share my recently completed interactive dashboard project built entirely in Microsoft Excel, where I analyzed a full year of Emergency Room data to generate actionable insights for healthcare decision-making.

This project was part of my learning with Satish Dhawale Sir, where I gained hands-on experience in:

ğŸ“Š Visualizing KPIs like admission rates, wait times & satisfaction scores

ğŸ“… Monthly trends analysis

ğŸ‘¥ Gender & Age group insights

ğŸ§  Department-wise patient referrals

ğŸ§© Dashboard design using slicers, pivot tables, and conditional formatting

This project not only strengthened my Excel skills but also helped me understand how to present data in a meaningful, business-focused way. The entire project is documented step-by-step in a presentation and Excel file.
